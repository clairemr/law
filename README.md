- Not easy to rebuild infra
- Hard to understand the infra architecture

# Features

- Initial base pipeline to deploy application
- Blue Green deployment + Delayed/Approval based switch
- Easy rollbacks

# Objectives

- Enterprise Infrastructure 
- Simple Deployments: Bootstrapping + Changes to the infrastructure.
